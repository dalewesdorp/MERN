## Overview

The platform offers a way to add, edit and delete these exercises and assign users exercises. This platforms main 
purpose is to get familiar with the MERN Stack and other functionalities. 

The demo is a more modern version of the demo provided in this [DEMO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CqJlxBYj-M).

## Development

### Technology stack

Since this is an MVP version of the platform and for the ease of deployment, we
have opted to not use microservices. Instead, there will be:

* A back-end application built in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) using [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* A front-end application built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and the [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) framework
* A MongoDB database (hosted on [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))

### Monorepo

This project is being developed in a single repository. This makes it easier to make changes to several parts of the 
project at once, without having to worry about version contraints and compatibility of the different parts of the project.

## Getting started

This step by step guide will familiarize you with the technologies of the MERN stack.


### Front-end

In this chapter we will go through all of the steps to set up all of the front-end technologies and frameworks.

#### 1. NodeJS

>We will be using the LTS version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). To switch node versions use a node version manager. 
The nvm [n](https://github.com/tj/n) is recommended.

```
node -v

sudo npm install -g n 
sudo n 14.15.4  # Current LTS
```

#### 2. Create React App

>[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) framework Create React App is an officially supported way to create single-page React 
>applications. It offers a modern build setup with no configuration.

```
npx create-react-app <name>

cd <name>
npm start
```

Why are we using Create React App? [Read more](https://codaisseur.com/blog/what-does-create-react-app-do/#:~:text=The%20create%20react%20app%20package,Dom%20with%20many%20other%20dependencies.)

#### 3. Bootstrap

>Quickly design and customize responsive mobile-first sites with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), the worldâ€™s most popular front-end open 
>source toolkit, featuring Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful JavaScript plugins.

```
npm install bootstrap
```

#### Include Bootstrap in your CSS
>Open the [App.jsx](./src/App.jsx) file generated by CRA and add the following import statement.

```
/* ./src/App.jsx */
import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
```

#### 4. Other dependencies

```
npm install axios react-datepicker
```

### Back-end

In this chapter we will go through all of the steps to set up all of the back-end technologies and frameworks.

#### 1. npm

>Create a folder within the root of your project called back-end and initialize npm in this folder.

```
mkdir backend
cd backend
npm init
```

#### 2. Express, Cors, Mongoose & dotenv

>Install [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Cors](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware/cors.html), 
>[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/), [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to setup your backend framework.

```
npm install express cors mongoose dotenv
```

#### 3. Nodemon

>Install a global local server.

```
sudo install -b nodemon
```

#### 4. Server

>After setting everything up following the tutorial provided in the [DEMO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CqJlxBYj-M) 
>you can run your server with the following command.

```
nodemon server
```

### Demo

To run the demo project navigate to the Demo folder and run the following commands in 2 differnt terminals

```
# Back-end

cd /Demo/backend
npm install
nodemon server
```

```
# Front-end

cd /Demo
npm install
npm start
```
